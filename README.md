# V Playground

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/vlang-playground.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vlang-playground)

Component that creates V-aware editors capable of running code from HTML block elements.

## Installation

### Use CDN

Insert a `<script>` element into your page and specify what elements should be converted in its `data-selector` attribute.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vlang-playground@1" data-selector="code"></script>
```

Mostly inspired by [Kotlin Playground](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-playground).
